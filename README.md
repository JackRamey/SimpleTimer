# SimpleTimer
A utility that allows for the addition of a countdown or countup timer. This timer
is akin to a stopwatch, rather than a "countdown to date" timer. The goal of this
project was to create a simple stopwatch that is visible from afar for use in workouts
or other timing applications where you want to set the timer and check it from across the
room.
